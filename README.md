domainage
=========

Tool(s) for web domain management and tracking.

Right now, it's just a whois lookup; example: whois.py arogi.com

The next step will be to store the results of such whois queries and then create a management GUI (or nice consumable file format)-- so domains can be managed/tracked wrt expiration dates, registrar, registrant, etc.
