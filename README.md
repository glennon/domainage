domainage
=========

Tool(s) for web domain management and tracking.

Right now, it's just a whois lookup; example: whois.py arogi.com

Next step is to store a pile of whois results in a useful format and location -- so domains can be managed/tracked wrt expiration dates, registrar, registrant, etc.
